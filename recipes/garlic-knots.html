                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, 
                            Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl; 
                            mix to combine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dust work surface with more flour. 
                            Transfer dough to work surface. 
                            Knead dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the palm 
                            of your hand. Add more flour (1 teaspoon at a 
                            time) as needed to keep dough from being too sticky.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). 
                            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a 
                            silicone baking mat.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench 
                            scraper, cut off 8 wedges of dough. Roll each 
                            wedge of dough into a rope shape and tie into 
                            knots. Place knots onto the prepared baking 
                            sheet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bake in the preheated oven until knots are lightly 
                            browned, 10 to 12 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil, garlic 
                            granules, and parsley for topping in a small 
                            glass bowl. Brush mixture over the warm knots.
                        </li>
